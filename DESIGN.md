# Design Considerations

### Handling of Coordinate System Transformations

Options:

1. Handle coordinate system transformations on the level where the transformation objects operate.
   The coordinate frame is assigned to the transformed object.
1. Handle coordinate system transformations deeper using a matrix of coordinate system transformation objects.
   A coordinate system transformation object has a "from" and a "to" coordinate system.
   Whenever a coordinate system transformation object is applied to an object with a "from" coordinate system, it turns into a "to" coordinate system.

Decision: 1.

Transforming certain tensors, e.g. a mass matrix, requires left and right multiplication with a transformation object.
This rules out option 2, as the two multiplications do not know about each other.
The information that the new coordinate system needs to be applied is only available on the level of the transformation object.
